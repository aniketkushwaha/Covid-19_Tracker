# Covid-19_Tracker
An app that i made to see the count of Covid-19 patients in India.

It is built using expandandable listview to show the list of states and we can also see the districts of every state by clicking on the
state , the data is fetched from 3 APIs one for the state ,one for the districts and one for the zones(Red,Green,Orange) of the districts.

Then there is an option menu where i have used preferences to save the user specified theme and also the user can toggle between the dark
and light theme using the switch preference .
